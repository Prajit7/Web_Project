        <p class="p1">Launched in 2010, Our technology platform connects customers, restaurant partners and delivery
            partners, serving their multiple needs. Customers use our platform to search and discover restaurants, read
            and write customer generated reviews and view and upload photos, order food delivery, book a table and make
            payments while dining-out at restaurants. On the other hand, we provide restaurant partners with
            industry-specific marketing tools which enable them to engage and acquire customers to grow their business
            while also providing a reliable and efficient last mile delivery service. We also operate a one-stop
            procurement solution, Hyperpure, which supplies high quality ingredients and kitchen products to restaurant
            partners. We also provide our delivery partners with transparent and flexible earning opportunities.

                    Catering Services means an establishment in which the principal use is the preparation of food and
                    meals on the premises, and where such food and meals are delivered to another location for
                    consumption.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Bulk Ordering</h2>
                <p class="center">An order to buy a large quantity of a good at once. This may occur at either the
                    retail or the wholesale levels. For example, a coffee shop may make a bulk order for coffee because
                    it needs to sell to its customers. An individual may order the same amount simply because he/she
                    does not want to go shopping for it very often. Buying in bulk is often less expensive per unit than
                    buying otherwise, because marginal costs tend to decrease the more a company produces or sells..</p>
